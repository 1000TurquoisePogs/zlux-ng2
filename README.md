# zlux-ng2
Angular2 Hosting Environment for the zLUX Framework's web components

This repository contains tooling that is positioned at a level above the Platform components within zlux-platform, which does not deal with UI components.
Yet, this repository is still below the level of the Angular 2 App Managers such as Mainframe Virtual Desktop (MVD).

The contents of this repository will change as content from Platform & App management are organized and enhanced to require distinct abilities from this layer.
